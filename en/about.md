TWVAL is Taiwan Vapor Advocacy League

TWVAL was formed in 2015 by members of an online forum as an advocacy group to raise awareness and protect our right to  access reduced harm alternatives. 

TWVAL was created as an answer to the anti-Tobacco Harm Reduction groups’ efforts to ban THR products and in the belief  that there is strength in our numbers.

TWVAL is not a trade organization.

TWVAL board of director members are all volunteers and receive no financial compensation.

Although donations to TWVAL are accepted from many sources, TWVAL has no financial or policy agreements with the electronic cigarette, tobacco or pharmaceutical industries.

TWVAL maintains a web site at Taiwan Vapor Advocacy League for the purpose of providing easy access for members and the  general public to news articles, Call to Action alerts, scientific research studies, petitions, legal actions, pending   legislation and educational materials regarding electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.

TWVAL coordinates activism efforts with other advocacy and harm reduction organizations such as [M.O.V.E.][1], [SFATA][2], [A.V.A.][3], [台灣電子煙公會 Taiwan Vape Association][4], [CASAA][5] and [台灣電子煙團結聯盟][6].

TWVAL works to increase it’s influence by organizing activist efforts through our members, writing pro-reduced harm articles and issuing statements to the media regarding positive and negative legislation.

TWVAL raises funds for promoting these activities and to assist in research efforts.

TWVAL develops and supplies print materials such as informative business cards for smokeless tobacco/e-cig users to hand out, decals, bumper stickers, t-shirts and promotional materials for vendors and businesses.

TWVAL’s web site is a neutral ground for vendors to send customers to learn more about electronic cigarettes and smokeless alternatives.

TWVAL has additional presence on other e-cig forums, [Facebook][10], and [Twitter][11]. There is also an active TWVAL member discussion group on Facebook called [Taiwan Vapor Advocacy League][12].
