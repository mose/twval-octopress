## Abstract

### Background and aims
Aldehydes are emitted by electronic cigarettes due to thermal decomposition of liquid components. Although elevated levels have been reported with new-generation high-power devices, it is unclear whether they are relevant to true exposure of users (vapers) because overheating produces an unpleasant taste, called a dry puff, which vapers learn to avoid. The aim was to evaluate aldehyde emissions at different power levels associated with normal and dry puff conditions.

### Design
Two customizable atomizers were prepared so that one (A1) had a double wick, resulting in high liquid supply and lower chance of overheating at high power levels, while the other (A2) was a conventional setup (single wick). Experienced vapers took 4-s puffs at 6.5 watts (W), 7.5W, 9W and 10W power levels with both atomizers and were asked to report whether dry puffs were generated. The atomizers were then attached to a smoking machine and aerosol was trapped.

### Setting
Clinic office and analytical chemistry laboratory in Greece.

### Participants
Seven experienced vapers.

### Measurements
Aldehyde levels were measured in the aerosol.

### Findings
All vapers identified dry puff conditions at 9W and 10W with A2. A1 did not lead to dry puffs at any power level. Minimal amounts of aldehydes per 10 puffs were found at all power levels with A1 (up to 11.3µg for formaldehyde, 4.5µg for acetaldehyde and 1.0µg for acrolein) and at 6.5W and 7.5W with A2 (up to 3.7µg for formaldehyde, 0.8µg for acetaldehyde and 1.3µg for acrolein). The levels were increased by 30 to 250 times in dry puff conditions (up to 344.6µg for formaldehyde, 206.3µg for acetaldehyde and 210.4µg for acrolein, P<0.001), while acetone was detected only in dry puff conditions (up to 22.5µg).

### Conclusions
Electronic cigarettes produce high levels of aldehyde only in dry puff conditions, in which the liquid overheats, causing a strong unpleasant taste that e-cigarette users detect and avoid. Under normal vaping conditions aldehyde emissions are minimal, even in new-generation high-power e-cigarettes.
